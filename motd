          Welcome to Bottlerocket's control container!
    ╱╲    
   ╱┄┄╲   This container gives you access to the Bottlerocket API,
   │▗▖│   which in turn lets you inspect and configure the system.
  ╱│  │╲  You'll probably want to use the `apiclient` tool for that;
  │╰╮╭╯│  for example, to inspect the system:
    ╹╹
             apiclient -u /settings

You can run `apiclient --help` for usage details, and check the main
Bottlerocket documentation for descriptions of all settings and examples of
changing them.

If you need to debug the system further, you can use the admin container.  The
admin container has more debugging tools installed and allows you to get root
access to the host.  The easiest way to get started is like this, which enables
and enters the admin container using apiclient:

   enter-admin-container

You can also access the admin container through SSH if you have network access.
Just enable the container like this, then SSH to the host:

   enable-admin-container

You can disable the admin container like this:

   disable-admin-container
